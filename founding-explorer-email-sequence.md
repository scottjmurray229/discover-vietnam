# Founding Explorer Email Sequence

Nine emails for the Founding Explorer beta program. Tone: Scott and Jenice talking to their extended circle — friends, family, balikbayans, partners of Filipinos. Not a travel brand emailing strangers.

---

## Email 1: Welcome

**Trigger:** Immediately after Survey 1 submission
**Subject:** You're in, {{first_name}} — thanks for helping us test this

Hey {{first_name}},

Thanks for signing up. Jenice and I have been building the Trip Companion based on everything we've learned from 20+ trips to the Philippines together, and we need real people to tell us what works and what doesn't before we put it out there.

You probably already know more about the Philippines than most travel apps assume. Maybe your partner's from there, maybe you've been back a dozen times, maybe you're heading over for the first time with someone who keeps saying "you'll love it, just trust me." Whatever the case — the Companion is meant to fill the gaps between what your family tells you and what you actually need when you're standing on a curb in Cebu trying to figure out which bus goes to Moalboal.

**Here's what happens from here:**

1. About two weeks before your departure ({{departure_date}}), we'll send you a link to install the Trip Companion on your phone.
2. You download your destinations for offline — takes 3 minutes on Wi-Fi.
3. On your trip, just use it whenever it's helpful. Directions, restaurants, prices, cultural tips. Everything works without signal.
4. When you're home, we'll send a short feedback form. Your answers directly shape what we build next.

That's it. No hoops.

If you have questions before then, just reply to this email. It comes straight to us.

— Scott & Jenice

P.S. — {{days_until_departure}} days until your trip. Not that we're counting. (We are.)

## Email 2: Pre-Trip Prep

**Trigger:** 14 days before departure date
**Subject:** 2 weeks out — let's get you set up

Hey {{first_name}},

Two weeks! Here's how to get the Trip Companion ready before you go.

**Set up now (3 minutes):**

1. **Install the app** — Open this link on your phone: [Trip Companion Link]. Tap "Add to Home Screen" when prompted. No app store needed.
2. **Download your destinations offline** — Open the app, go to each destination you're visiting, tap the download icon. This saves everything locally so it works with zero signal.
3. **Browse the packing list** — We've got a Philippines-specific one based on your destinations. Worth a look even if you've done this before.

**Jenice's tip:** Bring pasalubong from the US — Kirkland brand anything from Costco is gold. And if you're visiting family, bring more than you think you need. There's always one more tita who "didn't know you were coming."

Download everything while you're still on your home Wi-Fi. Don't wait for airport or hotel Wi-Fi — it's never fast enough.

The Companion has directions, restaurant picks, current prices, cultural tips, and offline maps. Everything works without internet once downloaded.

If the setup feels confusing, reply here. We'd rather sort it out now.

## Email 3: Departure Reminder

**Trigger:** 3 days before departure date
**Subject:** Almost time — quick checklist

Hey {{first_name}},

Three days out. Quick pre-flight list:

- [ ] Trip Companion installed, destinations downloaded for offline
- [ ] Passport valid for 6+ months past your return date
- [ ] Philippines eTravel registration completed (eTravel.gov.ph)
- [ ] Local SIM or eSIM plan sorted (Globe or Smart — Globe has better coverage on most islands)
- [ ] Peso cash for smaller islands (ATMs can be unreliable outside cities)

**One thing:** Make sure you've downloaded all your Companion destinations before you leave your last reliable Wi-Fi. Philippine mobile data is solid in cities but gets spotty fast outside metro areas. The Companion works with zero signal — maps, directions, emergency contacts, everything.

If you stumble on something other travelers should know — a great restaurant, an updated fare, a spot that surprised you — snap a photo or jot a note. You can share it all in your feedback when you're back and we'll credit you on the site.

We won't email you again until you're home. Enjoy the trip.

— Scott & Jenice

## Email 4: During Trip — SILENCE

**Trigger:** N/A (departure date through return date)
**Subject:** N/A

*No email is sent during this period.*

They're on their trip. We don't compete with family dinners and island hopping. The Companion works on its own; email stays quiet.

## Email 5: Welcome Back

**Trigger:** 3 days after return date
**Subject:** Welcome back, {{first_name}} — how'd it go?

Hey {{first_name}},

Welcome home. We hope it was a good one.

We're really curious how the Trip Companion held up — what was useful, what was wrong, what we should add. Your experience is exactly the kind of feedback that makes this better for the next person heading over.

Whenever you're ready (no rush — we know there's laundry and jet lag to deal with first):

**[Share Your Feedback →]({{feedback_url}})**

Takes about 5 minutes. Every answer goes directly to us — not a support inbox nobody checks.

If you discovered anything along the way — a fare that changed, a hidden restaurant, a route that's different now — there's a place in the feedback form to share it. We'll add the best tips to the site with your name, and you'll get lifetime free access to the Trip Companion as a thank-you.

Everyone who completes the feedback gets a **lifetime 30% discount** when we launch the paid version. We'll send your code as soon as we get your responses.

— Scott & Jenice

## Email 6: Survey Reminder

**Trigger:** 7 days after return date (only if feedback survey NOT completed)
**Subject:** Quick reminder — we'd really value your take

Hey {{first_name}},

Just a nudge — we haven't gotten your post-trip feedback yet, and your perspective would really help.

5 minutes: **[Complete Your Feedback →]({{feedback_url}})**

Your answers help us figure out what to build next, what to fix first, and whether our restaurant recommendations actually hold up. (Jenice is especially nervous about that last one.)

Completing it also unlocks your **lifetime 30% Founding Explorer discount**.

No pressure — the link stays active. But the sooner you fill it out, the fresher the details will be.

Thanks,
Scott & Jenice

## Email 7: Referral Ask

**Trigger:** 14 days after return date
**Subject:** Know anyone else heading over?

Hey {{first_name}},

Now that you've used the Trip Companion, we have a small ask: if you know anyone planning a trip to the Philippines — family, friends, someone in your Viber group who's been talking about it — would you send them our way?

We still have Founding Explorer spots open, and a recommendation from someone who actually used it means more than anything we could post.

**Share this link:** {{referral_url}}

If they sign up, they get the same free access you had — and we'll add an extra **10%** to your lifetime discount (stacks with your 30%).

And if you're up for a quick testimonial — even a sentence — it really helps:

**[Leave a Testimonial →]({{testimonial_url}})**

Thanks for being one of our first 100. It means a lot to us.

— Scott & Jenice

## Email 8: Paid Launch Announcement

**Trigger:** When beta period ends (manual send)
**Subject:** We're launching — and you helped build it

Hey {{first_name}},

The Founding Explorer beta is done, and the Trip Companion is going live at $7.99 per trip.

You were one of our first 100. Your feedback directly shaped what's launching — from the features we prioritized to the bugs we fixed to the restaurant recommendations we updated. We couldn't have done this without people willing to test something unfinished and tell us the truth about it.

**Your Founding Explorer perks are permanent:**

- **Lifetime {{discount_percentage}}% discount** on all future Trip Companion access
- **Founding Explorer badge** on your profile
- **Early access** to every new destination we add
- **Direct line to us** — you can always reply to these emails

Your discount code is **{{discount_code}}** — or just log in with your Founding Explorer email and it applies automatically.

We're starting with {{destination_count}} destinations and adding more every month. If there's a place you want us to cover next, just tell us.

Salamat,
Scott & Jenice

P.S. — If you haven't yet, there's still time to [leave a testimonial]({{testimonial_url}}). Every story from a real person helps someone else decide to try it.

## Email 9: Your Contribution Is Live

**Trigger:** Manual — sent by Scott when a contributor's content is published on the site
**Subject:** Your {{contribution_type}} is now on the site!

Hey {{first_name}},

Quick note — I just published your {{specific_contribution}} on the {{destination}} page. You can see it here: {{contribution_link}}

You're credited as a contributor, and as a thank-you, your Trip Companion access is now lifetime — every future trip to the Philippines, it's yours free.

Thanks for making the site better for the next person heading over.

— Scott & Jenice
