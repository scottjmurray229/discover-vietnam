      { label: 'E-Visa for Everyone Else', text: 'Citizens of all countries can apply for a 90-day single-entry e-visa online at evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn. Costs $25 USD, takes 3 business days. Print the approval letter before your flight. You can also get a visa on arrival with a pre-arranged approval letter, but e-visa is simpler.' },
      { label: 'Documents to Carry', text: 'Always lock your passport in your hotel safe when you\'re out exploring — carry a photocopy on your phone or on paper instead. Hotels will ask for your passport at check-in for registration, but after that it should stay locked up. Carry your passport on travel days between cities.' },
      { label: 'Customs Declaration', text: 'Fill out the customs and health declaration form on the plane or at the immigration kiosk. It takes about 5 minutes. Vietnam immigration is generally fast and efficient at major airports like Tan Son Nhat (HCMC), Noi Bai (Hanoi), and Da Nang.' },
      { label: 'Global Entry / SENTRI', text: 'If you\'re a US citizen, get Global Entry before your trip — it\'s about $120 for five years and worth every penny. The real payoff is coming home through any US international airport. After 15+ hours of travel, multiple jumbo jets land at the same time and the immigration line is massive. Global Entry gets you through in minutes instead of an hour-plus. It pays for itself after two trips.' },

Most ATMs dispense up to 3,000,000–5,000,000 VND per transaction. Withdrawal fees range from 22,000–55,000 VND ($1–2 USD). Store extra cash in your hotel safe. Some US banks reimburse ATM fees — I use a Fidelity Cash Management card exclusively over there and never pay a fee.' },
      { label: 'Split Your Cards', text: 'ALWAYS bring two or three ATM cards and credit cards on your trip. Only carry one of each when you go out — keep the backups locked in your hotel safe. Vietnam is very safe, but things fall out of pockets, bags get left behind, and if you lose your only card, your trip is over. I learned this the hard way.' },
      { label: 'Cash Is King', text: 'Outside Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, and major tourist hubs, many restaurants, motorbike taxis, markets, and guesthouses are cash-only. Always carry enough dong to cover 2–3 days of expenses, especially in rural areas and smaller towns.' },
      { label: 'Digital Payments', text: 'Vietnam is rapidly going cashless in cities. Many shops and restaurants accept bank transfers via QR code. MoMo and ZaloPay are the dominant mobile wallets, but they require a Vietnamese bank account to fully use. Visa and Mastercard work at most hotels, upscale restaurants, and tourist businesses.' },
      { label: 'Daily Budget Ranges', text: 'Backpacker: 500,000–800,000 VND/day ($20–32 USD) — hostels, street food, public transport. Mid-range: 1,500,000–3,000,000 VND/day ($60–120 USD) — hotels, restaurants, private tours. Luxury: 5,000,000+ VND/day ($200+ USD) — resorts, fine dining, private cars.' },
      { label: 'Exchange Tips', text: 'Change money at licensed gold shops (tiem vang) or banks for the best rates — gold shops in Hanoi\'s Old Quarter and HCMC\'s District 1 typically offer better rates than banks.

Book 2–4 weeks ahead for the best prices. One-way flights start at 500,000–1,500,000 VND ($20–60 USD). VietJet often has flash sales with fares under $10.' },
      { label: 'Reunification Express Train', text: 'Vietnam\'s iconic railway runs 1,726 km from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City, stopping at Hue, Da Nang, Nha Trang, and other cities. Soft sleeper berths cost 800,000–1,200,000 VND ($32–48 USD) for the full journey. Book at the station or through 12Go Asia. The Hai Van Pass stretch between Hue and Da Nang is one of the most scenic rail journeys in Southeast Asia.' },
      { label: 'Sleeper Buses', text: 'Long-distance sleeper buses connect major cities for 200,000–500,000 VND ($8–20 USD). Operators like The Sinh Tourist, Futa Bus, and Hoang Long run comfortable reclining-bed buses with AC and blankets. Overnight routes save a hotel night. Book through your hotel or at bus company offices — avoid touts at bus stations.' },
      { label: 'Grab & Ride-Hailing', text: 'Download the Grab app before your trip and add your international credit card when you land. Grab works well in Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang, Nha Trang, and most major cities — metered fares, no haggling, air-conditioned cars. GrabBike (motorcycle taxi) is cheaper and faster in traffic. Be and Xanh SM are local alternatives. Not available in smaller towns.' },
      { label: 'Motorbike Rental', text: 'Available everywhere for 100,000–200,000 VND/day ($4–8 USD) for semi-automatic scooters. An international driving permit (IDP) with motorcycle endorsement is technically required. Helmets are mandatory. Traffic in Hanoi and HCMC is intense — only ride if you\'re experienced. In smaller towns like Hoi An, Da Lat, and Phong Nha, renting a motorbike is the best way to explore. Important: rental shops may ask to hold your passport as a deposit — never hand it over. Offer a photocopy instead and walk away if they insist.' },
      { label: 'Boats & Cruises', text: 'Ha Long Bay overnight cruises range from 1,500,000–5,000,000 VND ($60–200 USD) per person. Mekong Delta day trips from Can Tho or HCMC cost 300,000–800,000 VND ($12–32 USD).

Calls are usually $0.20/minute, but don\'t call anyone unless it\'s an emergency. Install WhatsApp and Zalo before your trip — Zalo is how Vietnamese people communicate and how you\'ll message hotels, tour operators, and drivers.' },
      { label: 'eSIM & Local SIMs', text: 'Most newer phones are eSIM only, so you can\'t pop in a physical SIM anyway. If your carrier doesn\'t cover Vietnam, grab a Viettel, Mobifone, or Vinaphone eSIM through their app or buy a tourist SIM at Tan Son Nhat, Noi Bai, or Da Nang airport for 100,000–200,000 VND ($4–8 USD) with 10–30 GB of data. SIM registration requires your passport.' },
      { label: 'Data Coverage', text: '4G/LTE works in most cities and tourist areas. 5G is expanding in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Viettel has the widest coverage nationwide, including rural areas; Mobifone and Vinaphone are strong in cities. Top up via convenience stores (Circle K, Ministop) or the carrier\'s app — packages run 50,000–200,000 VND ($2–8 USD) for 3–30 GB.' },
      { label: 'WiFi Reliability', text: 'Hotel and cafe WiFi is generally excellent in cities and major tourist areas (10–50 Mbps). Vietnam has some of the best cafe WiFi in Southeast Asia. Remote mountain towns and islands can be slow or unavailable. Your mobile data is the backup plan — and the reason I always make sure my US carrier coverage is sorted before I land.' },

Get a policy that covers medical evacuation — the best hospitals are in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, and a medevac flight from a remote area can cost $10,000+. I use <a href="https://safetywing.com/?referenceID=24858745&utm_source=24858745&utm_medium=Ambassador" target="_blank" rel="noopener sponsored">SafetyWing</a> for every trip — it\'s affordable, covers nomads and short-trippers alike, and you can sign up even after you\'ve left home. I\'ve thankfully never had to file a claim, but having it is peace of mind every time I board that plane.' },
      { label: 'Tap Water', text: 'Don\'t drink tap water anywhere in Vietnam. Bottled water costs 5,000–10,000 VND ($0.20–0.40 USD) and is available everywhere. Ice in restaurants and cafes is almost always purified (tubular or hollow ice is safe; irregular chunks may not be). Vietnamese iced coffee is safe at any established cafe.' },
      { label: 'Hospitals & Clinics', text: 'Major cities have quality private hospitals: Vinmec International Hospital and Family Medical Practice (Hanoi and HCMC), FV Hospital (HCMC), and Da Nang Family Hospital (Da Nang). Smaller towns and remote areas may only have basic clinics — another reason for medevac insurance.' },
      { label: 'Dengue & Mosquitoes', text: 'Dengue is present year-round, especially during rainy season (May–Nov). Use mosquito repellent with DEET, wear long sleeves at dusk, and choose accommodation with screens or air conditioning. No vaccine is widely recommended for travelers.' },
      { label: 'Rainy Season & Weather', text: 'Vietnam\'s weather varies by region. The north (Hanoi, Sapa, Ha Long Bay) has a cool winter from November to March. Central Vietnam (Hue, Hoi An, Da Nang) gets heaviest rain in October–December. The south (HCMC, Mekong Delta, Phu Quoc) has rainy season from May to November. Monitor weather via nchmf.gov.vn and airline alerts. Always have buffer days in your itinerary.' },
      { label: 'General Safety', text: 'Vietnam is generally very safe for tourists. Use common sense: avoid flashing expensive items, be careful crossing streets (traffic is intense), and keep valuables in a hotel safe. Bag-snatching by motorbike is the main risk in HCMC — carry bags on the building side of the sidewalk, not the street side.' },

You\'ll use this every single day.' },

Do NOT bring any appliances — I plugged in a Keurig and it popped the circuit breaker instantly. Hair dryers, curling irons, and anything with a heating element will fry unless it\'s rated 110–240V.

  <!-- FAQ -->
  <FAQ items={[
    { question: "Do I need a visa to visit Vietnam?", answer: "Citizens of 13 countries (including USA, UK, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea) can enter Vietnam visa-free for up to 45 days. Everyone else can apply for a 90-day e-visa online at evisa.xuatnhapcanh.gov.vn for $25 USD. Bring a return or onward ticket — immigration may ask for proof of departure." },
    { question: "Is Vietnam safe for tourists?", answer: "Vietnam is generally very safe for tourists. Bag-snatching by motorbike is the main risk in Ho Chi Minh City — carry bags on the building side of the sidewalk. Use common sense: don't flash expensive items, use Grab for transport, and be careful crossing streets (traffic is intense but predictable once you learn the flow). Tourist areas are well-policed." },
    { question: "How much money should I bring to Vietnam?", answer: "Budget travelers: 500,000-800,000 VND/day ($20-32 USD) covers hostels, street food, and public transport. Mid-range: 1,500,000-3,000,000 VND/day ($60-120 USD) for hotels, restaurants, and activities. Luxury: 5,000,000+ VND/day ($200+ USD) for resorts and private tours. Withdraw dong from ATMs (Vietcombank, BIDV have the best rates). Notify your bank before traveling. Cash is essential in smaller towns." },
    { question: "Can I use my credit card in Vietnam?", answer: "Credit cards are accepted at hotels, malls, and upscale restaurants in major cities. However, most local restaurants, markets, street food stalls, and small businesses are cash-only. Always carry 500,000-1,000,000 VND in cash. Visa and Mastercard are widely accepted where cards work; Amex is less common. ATM withdrawal limits are typically 3,000,000-5,000,000 VND per transaction." },
    { question: "What is the best way to get around Vietnam?", answer: "Between cities: domestic flights (VietJet Air, Vietnam Airlines, Bamboo Airways) or the Reunification Express train. Within cities: Grab (ride-hailing app) and GrabBike for beating traffic. Between nearby cities: sleeper buses (The Sinh Tourist, Futa Bus). Renting a motorbike costs 100,000-200,000 VND/day and is the best way to explore smaller towns like Hoi An, Da Lat, and Phong Nha." },
    { question: "Do I need a SIM card for Vietnam?", answer: "If your US carrier covers Vietnam (T-Mobile, Google Fi, AT&T International Day Pass), you may not need one. Otherwise, buy a Viettel, Mobifone, or Vinaphone SIM at the airport for 100,000-200,000 VND ($4-8 USD) with 10-30 GB of data. 4G is widespread in tourist areas. Remote mountain areas may have spotty coverage — Viettel has the widest reach." },
