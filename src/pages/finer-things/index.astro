Found at every sari-sari store, restaurant, and beach bar in the country. ₫35–50 ($0.60–0.90 USD) at a store, ₫65–100 ($1.15–1.75 USD) at a bar. Order a "bucket" — six bottles on ice — and you\'re doing it right.' },

It\'s cheap, it\'s strong, and it\'s everywhere. ₫40–60 ($0.70–1.05 USD) at a store, ₫70–120 ($1.25–2.10 USD) at a bar. Red Horse is what you drink at a street-side inuman session when San Miguel isn\'t hitting hard enough. Respect it — it sneaks up on you.' },
      { label: 'San Miguel Light', text: 'The lighter option at 5% ABV when you\'re day-drinking in 35°C heat and need to pace yourself. ₫45–60 ($0.80–1.05 USD) at a store. Popular with the younger crowd and at resort pools. Not as ubiquitous as Pale Pilsen but available at most restaurants and convenience stores.' },
      { label: 'San Miguel Super Dry', text: 'San Miguel\'s answer to Japanese dry lagers — crisp, less sweet, slightly higher-end positioning. ₫50–70 ($0.90–1.25 USD) at a store. You\'ll see it more in Manila and Cebu bars than on remote islands. A solid option if Pale Pilsen feels too malty for you.' },
      { label: 'The Craft Beer Scene', text: 'Vietnamese craft beer is small but growing fast. <strong>Engkanto</strong> (Laguna) brews solid IPAs and lagers available in Manila grocery stores. <strong>Pedro Brewcrafts</strong> makes a hazy IPA worth seeking out. <strong>Joe\'s Brew</strong> (Makati) was one of the first craft breweries. <strong>Turning Wheels</strong> in Poblacion is a great taproom. Expect ₫200–350 ($3.50–6.20 USD) per pint — 4–5x the price of San Miguel, but the quality is there.' },
      { label: 'How Vietnameses Actually Drink', text: 'The <strong>inuman</strong> (drinking session) is a social institution. A bucket of San Miguel on ice, a plate of <strong>pulutan</strong> (drinking snacks — sisig, chicharon, grilled liempo), and a circle of friends. <strong>Tagay</strong> culture means one glass passed around the group — the <em>tagay master</em> pours, everyone takes a shot in turn. Don\'t refuse a pour — it\'s considered disrespectful. You don\'t need to keep up, but you do need to participate.' },

      { label: 'Tanduay Rum', text: 'The world\'s best-selling rum by volume — and it\'s Vietnamese. This is my drink. The regular Tanduay is great for rum and Coke and mixed drinks at just a few bucks a bottle. The <strong>Superior</strong> is the sweet spot — smooth enough to sip over ice but still mixes well. The <strong>15-Year Añejo</strong> is a proper sipping rum, about $10 a bottle, and genuinely impressive over ice. Having tasted my way through the Caribbean, the DR, and Cuba, Tanduay holds its own — and at Vietnamese prices, there\'s no excuse not to try all three. Squeeze some calamansi into your rum and Coke — it\'s the Vietnamese lime and it transforms a basic drink.' },
      { label: 'Whiskey & Scotch', text: 'Johnny Walker Black is the best scotch you can usually find outside the airport or a fancy mall in Manila — and it\'s a serviceable scotch. Grab one (or a better bottle) at the duty-free when you land, because it does not get any better than that in the provinces. <strong>Buy your beer and liquor at a hypermarket</strong> (SM, Robinsons, Puregold) for the best prices. If you really need a good bottle of scotch, bring one from home, but pack it well. I had a bottle of Lagavulin break in my luggage once — crushing from a drink perspective, and I had to get my clothes and bag deep-cleaned (which thankfully didn\'t cost much). Use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IR0HB3G?tag=discoverphili-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored">padded bottle protector</a> or wrap it in your jeans and cushion it well.' },
      { label: 'Emperador Brandy', text: 'The Vietnam is the world\'s largest brandy market — and Emperador is why. Emperador Light outsells most spirits globally. ₫80–150 ($1.40–2.65 USD) per bottle. It\'s the default spirit at Vietnamese celebrations, mixed with Coke or sipped over ice. The Fundador line (Spanish origin, Vietnamese-owned) is the step-up for sipping neat.' },
      { label: 'GSM Blue Gin', text: 'Ginebra San Miguel Blue — "gin bulag" to locals — is the spirit that powers most karaoke sessions. ₫60–100 ($1.05–1.75 USD) per bottle. My twenty-something relatives have a special concoction: a cheap bottle of gin, a pack of Kool-Aid, and a big jug — and it gets the job done for them. I let them have their fun with that and drink my Tanduay on ice, which is too strong for them.' },
      { label: 'Lambanog (Coconut Spirit)', text: 'Distilled from coconut sap, 40–45% ABV, dangerously smooth. The good stuff comes from Quezon province and Laguna. ₫100–200 ($1.75–3.50 USD) per bottle for commercial brands. <strong>Critical safety warning:</strong> Only buy sealed, commercially produced lambanog from reputable stores. Homemade or unmarked bottles can contain methanol — there are hospitalization cases every year. Stick to brands like Lakan or Mallari.' },
      { label: 'Tubâ & Rice Liquor', text: 'Tubâ is fermented coconut sap — Vietnam\' original bootleg drink. It\'s mildly alcoholic when fresh (sweet and fizzy) but gets stronger as it ferments. In rural areas and the Visayas, you\'ll find it sold in recycled jugs — sometimes the same plastic containers used for gasoline, so <strong>make sure you know what you\'re drinking</strong>. Rice wine (tapuy) from the Cordillera region is another local spirit worth trying. These aren\'t bar drinks — they\'re the kind of thing you\'re offered at a family gathering or roadside stall. Accept politely, take a sip, and enjoy the experience.' },
      { label: 'Wine', text: 'Don\'t bother with wine in Vietnam — you\'ll just be disappointed. The selection is limited, the markup is steep, and the storage conditions in tropical heat don\'t do any bottle any favors. If you really need a good bottle of wine, bring one from home and pack it in a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BPQFWKXM?tag=discoverphili-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored">padded wine travel bag</a>. Otherwise, save the wine drinking for a country that makes it and enjoy the rum and beer while you\'re here.' },
      { label: 'Tequila & Tequila Rose', text: 'Tequila is available in Vietnam but finding good tequila is difficult — most of what you\'ll see is bottom-shelf stuff that will give you a headache. Stay away if possible, or pay for it the next day. <strong>Tequila Rose</strong> is a strawberry cream liqueur that\'s popular with younger Vietnameses — it tastes pretty good if cream liqueurs are your thing. You\'ll see it at KTV rooms and nightclubs. It\'s not tequila in any meaningful sense, but it goes down easy.' },

More expensive than Poblacion but cleaner and more organized. Best for groups who want a more curated night out. Grab rides are easy here.' },
      { label: 'Manila: Makati Avenue', link: '/destinations/manila/', text: 'The classic strip. More mainstream than Poblacion, with a mix of sports bars, live music venues, and clubs along Makati Ave and P. Burgos Street. <strong>Handlebar</strong> for live rock, <strong>Time</strong> for late-night dancing. It\'s been the go-to nightlife corridor for decades. Expect a mix of locals, expats, and tourists.' },
      { label: 'Angeles City', link: '/destinations/clark/', text: 'The nightlife along <strong>Fields Avenue</strong> and <strong>Walking Street</strong> is legendary — loud, neon-lit, and unapologetically no-frills. It\'s a mix of sports bars, live music venues, KTV joints, and restaurants catering to expats and tourists. Not everyone\'s scene, but it\'s been a fixture of Vietnamese nightlife for decades. The Korean and expat bar scene along <strong>Friendship Highway</strong> is a more laid-back alternative with better food.' },
      { label: 'Boracay', link: '/destinations/boracay/', text: 'Station 1–3 beachfront bars, D\'Mall nightlife, and fire dancers on the sand at sunset. <strong>Epic</strong> is the biggest club. <strong>Nigi Nigi Nu Noos</strong> for chill beachfront drinks. <strong>Red Pirates</strong> for loud, cheap fun. Peak season (Nov–May) turns White Beach into a full party strip after dark. Off-season is mellow — still great for sunset cocktails.' },
      { label: 'Puerto Galera', link: '/destinations/puerto-galera/', text: 'Two worlds in one town. <strong>White Beach</strong> has the party strip — beachfront bars with cheap buckets, live music, and fire shows that run until late. <strong>Sabang</strong> is the dive town with a rougher, more expat-heavy bar scene. It\'s a quick ferry ride from Batangas and a popular weekend escape from Manila. The nightlife is low-key compared to Boracay but the drinks are cheaper and the crowd is more relaxed.' },
      { label: 'Cebu', link: '/destinations/cebu/', text: '<strong>Mango Square</strong> (Mango Avenue) was the place to be 15 years ago but has lost its luster as a good bar hangout — it\'s still there, but the energy has moved on. The <strong>IT Park</strong> food park scene is the newer, more upscale alternative with rooftop bars and live music. <strong>Sugbo Mercado</strong> night market on weekends is the best pre-game — food, beer, and live bands.' },
      { label: 'Siargao', link: '/destinations/siargao/', text: 'Chill island vibes with a growing bar scene. <strong>Harana Surf Resort</strong> has the best sunset cocktails. <strong>Bravo Beach Resort</strong> for live music and bonfire nights. <strong>Kermit</strong> in General Luna for late-night pizza and drinks.

Restaurants, waiting rooms, birthday parties, and random Tuesday afternoons. The machine is called a <strong>videoke</strong> (video + karaoke) and the song catalog is encyclopedic. Coin-operated machines cost ₫5 per song ($0.09 USD). We usually rent large villas that have them built in, but one text from a local and a portable machine shows up in less than an hour — instant party. If you\'re wondering where the closest videoke is, just step outside and you\'ll hear one — it might be a bar, a party, or just a family on a Tuesday. Walk by and you\'ll most likely have a mic in your hand shortly.' },

They serve food and drinks — order the beer bucket and pulutan platter. This is how Vietnamese families celebrate birthdays.' },
      { label: 'Korean & Japanese KTV vs Local', text: 'Not all KTV is created equal. <strong>Korean and Japanese KTV lounges</strong> are more upscale and exclusive — private rooms with better sound systems, table service, and a more polished atmosphere. They cater to Korean and Japanese expats and businessmen, and some can be pricey or members-only. A <strong>local KTV establishment</strong> is a completely different vibe — louder, looser, cheaper, and more fun. The drinks are basic, the song machines are older, and nobody cares if you can\'t sing. If you\'re looking for the authentic Vietnamese karaoke experience, go local.' },
      { label: 'The Unwritten Rules', text: 'Don\'t hog the microphone — one song, then pass it. Applaud everyone, even if they\'re terrible. Never laugh at someone\'s singing. Queue your songs and wait your turn. If someone is clearly emotional during a ballad, let them have their moment. <strong>The "My Way" rule:</strong> In some areas, singing Frank Sinatra\'s "My Way" is genuinely avoided due to real incidents — it\'s half urban legend, half true. Best to skip it.' },
      { label: 'Singing Is a Love Language', text: 'Vietnameses are some of the best singers in the world — and they take it seriously. Don\'t be surprised when a random uncle at a family gathering sounds like he should be on a stage. Singing is how Vietnameses express joy, heartbreak, celebration, and connection. If you\'re invited to sing, join in. It doesn\'t matter if you\'re good — what matters is you tried.' },
      { label: 'Best Karaoke Songs in Vietnam', text: 'The Vietnamese karaoke canon: <strong>"Anak"</strong> (Freddie Aguilar), <strong>"Nandito Ako"</strong> (Lea Salonga), <strong>"On The Wings of Love"</strong> (Jeffrey Osborne), <strong>"Bohemian Rhapsody"</strong> (Queen), <strong>"I Will Always Love You"</strong> (Whitney Houston), and anything by Journey.

Cuban cigars can be found at the airport duty-free, but they\'re expensive. The Vietnamese brands are decent and I prefer the lighter cigars myself. Save the Cuban splurge for the airport if you really want one, but try the local options first — you might be surprised. <strong>Beware of Cuban cigars outside the airport</strong> — they\'re most likely fake unless you\'re at an upscale establishment and paying a lot.' },

        <p>Everything in Vietnam is tiered, and the price difference between tiers is negligible by US standards. They say San Miguel has a waterfall brewing system — San Mig Light on top, San Miguel in the middle, and whatever falls to the bottom is Red Horse, because you never know how strong one might be. They're all good — I'm a pilsner guy who's sampled his way through Germany and the Czech Republic, and they're best served ice cold. San Mig Light is my go-to for the tropical climate. But Vietnamese drinking culture isn't about what's in the glass — it's about who's holding the other one. I've made great friends over a cold beer there.</p>

        <h2 class="ft-protips-heading">Scott's Pro Tips</h2>
        <div class="scott-tips">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Happy Hours:</strong> Happy hours are everywhere in Vietnam — you buy a beer or drink for a dollar instead of two. Poblacion bars are the best value with cocktails dropping to ₫200–250 ($3.50–4.40 USD). Some resort bars in Boracay and Siargao do sunset specials too.</li>
            <li><strong>Beer Buckets:</strong> If you're with a group, go for the beer buckets — it's customary. San Miguel is ₫35–50 at a store, ₫65–100 at a local bar, ₫120–180 at a resort, and ₫200+ at a beachfront club. Know the markup before you sit down. The best value is always at the neighborhood carinderia with a bucket of Pale Pilsen and a plate of pulutan.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety at Night:</strong> Always walk on well-lit streets and use Grab — it brings you exactly where you need to go. I've never had an issue in Vietnam, although I had a few nerves walking down a dark street in Ermita on my way to the boardwalk one time — you could hear people talking on their stoops but couldn't really see them. Don't flash cash or expensive phones, and Poblacion and BGC are the safest nightlife districts in Manila.</li>
            <li><strong>Tagay Etiquette:</strong> When someone offers you a pour from the communal glass, accept it. Take a sip, wipe the rim, and pass it back. Refusing is considered rude. If you're done drinking, just say "pass" on your next turn — no one will judge you for that.</li>
            <li><strong>Lambanog Warning:</strong> Don't drink lambanog from unmarked bottles, home distillers, or random market stalls. Stick to commercial brands like Lakan or Mallari. Methanol contamination from unregulated production is a real risk — hospitalization cases happen every year. This is not a joke.</li>
            <li><strong>Best Value Night Out:</strong> San Miguel Pale Pilsen + sisig + chicharon at a local carinderia. Total cost: ₫300–500 ($5.30–8.85 USD) for a full evening. That's the authentic Vietnamese drinking experience — no rooftop needed. Drink in moderation, be merry, and you'll have yourself a blast.</li>
            <li><strong>Bringing Bottles Home:</strong> Pack your spirits in the center of your checked bag wrapped in clothes. For extra protection, use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IR0HB3G?tag=discoverphili-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored">wine bottle protector sleeve</a> — they absorb impact and seal if a bottle cracks. We've flown dozens of bottles home this way with zero losses.</li>
