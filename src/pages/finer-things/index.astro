It\'s light, refreshing, and meant to be drunk fast because there are no preservatives. Hanoi\'s Old Quarter is ground zero — the corner of Ta Hien and Luong Ngoc Quyen is where tourists and locals collide over cold glasses. Every neighborhood has its own bia hoi joint. Sit down, point at the keg, and someone will pour you one.' },
      { label: 'Bia Saigon', text: 'The south\'s beer of choice. <strong>Saigon Special</strong> (green label) is the premium version — smooth and balanced. <strong>Saigon Export</strong> (red label) is the everyday option. 15,000-25,000 VND ($0.60-1.00 USD) at a store, 30,000-50,000 VND ($1.20-2.00 USD) at a restaurant. You\'ll see it everywhere south of Da Nang. Served ice-cold, often with actual ice cubes dropped in the glass — which is perfectly normal here.' },
      { label: 'Bia Ha Noi', text: 'The north\'s answer to Saigon beer. Slightly maltier, with a distinctive flavor that locals are fiercely loyal to. 12,000-20,000 VND ($0.50-0.80 USD) at a store. The rivalry between Bia Ha Noi and Bia Saigon is real — ordering the wrong one in the wrong city will get you a look. When in Hanoi, drink Hanoi beer. When in Saigon, drink Saigon beer. Simple.' },
      { label: 'Tiger, Heineken & 333', text: '<strong>Tiger</strong> is everywhere and is the reliable international option. <strong>Heineken</strong> is considered premium and is popular for toasting at celebrations. <strong>333 (Ba Ba Ba)</strong> is the classic Vietnamese lager — light, cheap, and a solid session beer. 20,000-35,000 VND ($0.80-1.40 USD) at a store. All three are ubiquitous across the country.' },
      { label: 'The Craft Beer Scene', text: 'Vietnamese craft beer is booming, especially in HCMC and Hanoi. <strong>Pasteur Street Brewing</strong> (HCMC) leads the pack with creative tropical IPAs using local ingredients like jasmine and passion fruit. <strong>Heart of Darkness</strong> (HCMC) brews outstanding stouts and pale ales. <strong>Furbrew</strong> and <strong>Standing Bar</strong> in Hanoi are worth seeking out. Expect 60,000-120,000 VND ($2.40-4.80 USD) per pint — 5-10x the price of bia hoi, but the quality is there.' },

The phrase <strong>"mot, hai, ba, yo!"</strong> (one, two, three, cheers!) echoes through every restaurant at dinner time. Everyone clinks glasses, makes eye contact, and drinks together. It\'s rude to drink alone — always toast the table. <strong>Ice in beer</strong> is standard practice, not a tourist trap. Vietnamese love drinking snacks: grilled squid, boiled peanuts, green mango with chili salt. The session goes until the food runs out or everyone\'s had enough — there\'s no rush.' },

Dark roasted robusta beans dripped through a metal <strong>phin</strong> filter over sweetened condensed milk, then poured over ice. The result is intensely strong, sweet, and addictive. 20,000-40,000 VND ($0.80-1.60 USD) at a street stall or local cafe. Once you develop the taste, regular coffee never hits the same.' },
      { label: 'Ca Phe Trung (Egg Coffee)', text: 'Hanoi\'s signature creation — whipped egg yolks with sugar and condensed milk on top of strong black coffee. It\'s like a warm, caffeinated custard. <strong>Cafe Giang</strong> on Nguyen Huu Huan street claims to have invented it in 1946. 30,000-50,000 VND ($1.20-2.00 USD). Sounds weird, tastes incredible. Get it hot — the warm version is far superior to iced.' },
      { label: 'Ca Phe Den (Black Coffee)', text: 'For purists — black coffee, no milk, served hot or iced (<strong>ca phe den da</strong>). Vietnamese robusta is strong and slightly bitter with a chocolate undertone. It\'s what most working Vietnamese drink throughout the day. The phin filter on top of your cup is part of the ritual — you wait for it to drip, then stir and drink.' },
      { label: 'The Coffee Shop Scene', text: 'Vietnam is the world\'s second-largest coffee producer, and the cafe culture reflects it. <strong>The Highlands Coffee</strong> chain is Vietnam\'s Starbucks — reliable and everywhere. <strong>Cong Ca Phe</strong> has a retro communist aesthetic and coconut coffee. <strong>Trung Nguyen Legend</strong> serves premium Vietnamese coffee. But the best experience is at a tiny sidewalk cafe on a plastic stool, watching motorbikes go by while your phin drips.' },
      { label: 'Weasel Coffee (Ca Phe Chon)', text: 'Coffee beans eaten and excreted by civets, then collected, cleaned, and roasted. It\'s real, it\'s expensive (200,000-500,000 VND / $8-20 USD per cup), and the ethical concerns are valid — many civet farms keep animals in poor conditions. If you want to try it, look for wild-sourced brands. Honestly, a well-made ca phe sua da is more satisfying than most weasel coffee I\'ve tried.' },
      { label: 'Bring It Home', text: 'Vietnamese coffee makes an excellent souvenir. <strong>Trung Nguyen</strong> is the most famous brand — their Creative series is solid. <strong>Highlands Coffee</strong> sells ground coffee at their shops. For the best value, buy at a local market or supermarket. Pick up a <strong>phin filter</strong> (20,000-50,000 VND) to brew properly at home. The trick is sweetened condensed milk — without it, you\'re just making strong black coffee.' },

More of a novelty and supposed health tonic than a serious drink. 100,000-500,000 VND ($4-20 USD) per bottle. Makes a conversation-starting souvenir. The taste is essentially rice wine with a slightly musky note.' },

Imported whiskey (Johnnie Walker, Chivas) is available everywhere but at a premium. The duty-free at the airport is where to buy imported spirits. Local Vietnamese vodkas run 50,000-150,000 VND ($2-6 USD) per bottle — not world-class, but they get the job done mixed with soda or juice.' },

Hanoi\'s <strong>Polite Pub</strong> and <strong>Ne Cocktail Bar</strong> are worth seeking out. Expect 100,000-250,000 VND ($4-10 USD) per cocktail at a proper bar — a fraction of what you\'d pay in Bangkok or Singapore for the same quality.' },

        <p>Vietnamese drinking culture is communal in a way that catches you off guard. You sit down at a bia hoi joint on a tiny plastic stool, someone pours you a glass of fresh beer for 5,000 dong, and suddenly the whole table is clinking glasses shouting "mot, hai, ba, yo!" The coffee culture is even more surprising — ca phe sua da hits different when you're watching motorbikes weave past from a sidewalk stool at 7am. And the egg coffee in Hanoi is one of those things that sounds wrong but tastes absolutely right. I've sampled my way through a lot of countries, and Vietnam punches way above its weight.</p>

      <div class="ft-protips-card">
        <h2 class="ft-protips-heading">Scott's Pro Tips</h2>
        <div class="scott-tips">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Happy Hours:</strong> Saigon rooftop bars run happy hours from 4-7pm with cocktails at 50% off. District 2 and the Bitexco area have the best deals. Beach bars in Nha Trang and Da Nang do sunset specials too. Even without happy hour, a cocktail in Vietnam costs a fraction of what you'd pay in Bangkok or Singapore.</li>
            <li><strong>Bia Hoi Strategy:</strong> Bia hoi is cheapest and freshest in the morning (the kegs are delivered daily). By evening the popular spots run out. Hanoi's Old Quarter bia hoi joints are touristy but still cheap. For the local experience, find a neighborhood spot away from Ta Hien Street — same beer, half the hassle.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety at Night:</strong> Use Grab for getting around at night — it's safe, cheap, and logs your route. Keep your phone secure — bag snatching from motorbikes happens in HCMC. Don't leave your phone on the table at sidewalk bars. Stick to well-lit areas and avoid deserted alleys late at night. Bui Vien and the Old Quarter are generally safe due to the crowds.</li>
            <li><strong>Drinking Etiquette:</strong> When someone says "mot, hai, ba, yo!" you drink. It's the Vietnamese cheers and it happens constantly. Make eye contact when clinking glasses. It's rude to drink without toasting the group. If you want to slow down, just sip instead of draining the glass — nobody will pressure you.</li>
            <li><strong>Coffee Timing:</strong> The best ca phe sua da is from small street-side stalls, not chains. Egg coffee is a Hanoi thing — don't expect it in the south. Vietnamese coffee is strong — if you drink it after 3pm, expect to be awake until midnight. The phin filter takes 5 minutes to drip — that's the point, not a problem.</li>
            <li><strong>Best Value Night Out:</strong> Bia hoi + grilled squid + boiled peanuts at a street-side stall. Total cost: 100,000-200,000 VND ($4-8 USD) for a full evening. That's the authentic Vietnamese drinking experience — no rooftop needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Bringing Bottles Home:</strong> Pack your spirits in the center of your checked bag wrapped in clothes. For extra protection, use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IR0HB3G?tag=discovervn-20" target="_blank" rel="nofollow sponsored">wine bottle protector sleeve</a> — they absorb impact and seal if a bottle cracks.</li>
