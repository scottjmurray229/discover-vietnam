      <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>By using discovervietnam.info, you agree to these terms. If you don't agree, please don't use the site.</p>

      <h2>What We Provide</h2>
      <p>Discover Vietnam provides travel information, guides, and tools based on our personal experiences. While we strive for accuracy, travel conditions change — prices, schedules, and availability may differ from what we've published.</p>

      <h2>Travel Decisions</h2>
      <p>Our content is informational, not professional travel advice. You are responsible for your own travel decisions, including verifying current conditions, safety advisories, visa requirements, and health precautions before traveling.</p>

      <h2>Affiliate Links</h2>
      <p>Some links on this site are affiliate links. When you book through them, we may earn a commission at no extra cost to you. This does not influence our recommendations — we only link to services we've personally used. See our <a href="/legal/affiliate-disclosure/">full affiliate disclosure</a>.</p>

      <h2>AI Trip Planner</h2>
      <p>Our AI Trip Planner generates itinerary suggestions based on your inputs and our curated knowledge base. These are starting points for planning, not guaranteed travel plans. Always verify details independently before booking.</p>

      <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>All content, photography, video, and design on this site is owned by Discover Vietnam unless otherwise noted. You may share links to our content but may not reproduce, republish, or redistribute our materials without written permission.</p>
