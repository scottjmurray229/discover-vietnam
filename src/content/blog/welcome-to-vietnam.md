## A New Kind of Vietnam Travel Guide

I started Discover Vietnam because I was tired of travel guides that felt like they were written by someone who'd never actually haggled for a bowl of pho at 6 AM in Hanoi's Old Quarter.

Every guide on this site comes from trips I've actually taken. The prices are what I actually paid. The restaurants are where I actually ate. And the hotels are where I actually slept — sometimes well, sometimes not so much.

## What You'll Find Here

Vietnam is one of the most rewarding countries I've ever traveled through. From the misty mountains of Sapa to the floating markets of the Mekong Delta, every region has its own rhythm, its own flavors, and its own way of surprising you.

Here's what I'm building:

- **13 destination guides** covering Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City, Da Nang, Hoi An, Hue, Ha Long Bay, Sapa, Nha Trang, Phu Quoc, Dalat, Ninh Binh, Mui Ne, and Can Tho
- **Real prices in VND and USD** — because knowing a bowl of bun cha costs 40,000 VND (~$1.60) matters more than a vague "budget-friendly" label
- **Honest recommendations** — I'll tell you which tourist traps to skip and which hidden gems are worth the detour
- **An AI trip planner** that builds custom itineraries based on your interests and budget

## The Vietnam I Know

My first trip to Vietnam was chaos in the best possible way. I landed in Hanoi, stepped into traffic that seemed to operate on pure faith, and within an hour I was sitting on a tiny plastic stool eating the best pho of my life.

Since then, I've returned multiple times. I've taken the Reunification Express from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City, explored the caves of Phong Nha, watched sunrise over Ha Long Bay from a junk boat deck, and gotten hopelessly lost in Hoi An's lantern-lit streets.

This site is my attempt to share everything I've learned — the practical stuff that actually matters when you're on the ground.

## Coming Soon

I'm actively building out destination guides, food recommendations, and practical tips. If you want to be notified when new guides drop, sign up for the newsletter. No spam, just useful travel intel.

Welcome aboard. Vietnam is waiting.
