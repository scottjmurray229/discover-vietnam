## Why Should Hanoi Be Your First Stop in Vietnam?

Hanoi grabbed me by the collar and never let go. I arrived on a red-eye flight, bleary and disoriented, and stepped out of Noi Bai Airport into a wall of humidity that felt like walking into a warm, wet blanket. The taxi driver weaved through motorbike swarms with the calm confidence of a man who had done this ten thousand times before. By the time I reached the Old Quarter, the city had already begun rewriting every assumption I had about Southeast Asia.

My first morning in Hanoi started at 5:30 a.m. — not by choice, but because the symphony of honking, street vendor calls, and roosters crowing from somewhere impossibly nearby made sleeping in an act of futility. I stumbled downstairs from my guesthouse and found a woman ladling steaming pho bo from an enormous pot into bowls for a line of construction workers squatting on tiny plastic stools. She thrust a bowl into my hands, pointed at the herbs, and charged me 35,000 VND ($1.40). It was, without exaggeration, one of the best meals of my life.

Hanoi is Vietnam's capital, but calling it that undersells everything the city actually is. This is a place where thousand-year-old temples sit wedged between French colonial villas and Soviet-era apartment blocks. Where elderly men practice tai chi beside lakes at dawn while teenagers livestream on TikTok ten meters away. Where the street food is so legendary that Anthony Bourdain once called it his favorite city on Earth for eating. He was right.

What I love most about Hanoi is its refusal to be convenient. The city does not make itself easy for tourists, and that's precisely the point. The Old Quarter's streets tangle into each other like a bowl of bun cha noodles. The traffic has no discernible rules. The weather oscillates between sweltering and surprisingly cold. But within that chaos lives a city with more soul, more history, and more character per square meter than almost anywhere else I've traveled.

If you're reading this trying to decide whether to start your Vietnam trip in Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh City, my answer is unequivocal: start here. Start where Vietnam's story begins.

## What Makes Hanoi Different From Other Southeast Asian Capitals?

Hanoi stands apart because it never sold its soul. While Bangkok gleams with skyscrapers and Singapore polishes itself into futuristic sterility, Hanoi kept its crumbling French shutters, its incense-clouded temples, its grandmothers carrying shoulder poles of fresh fruit down alleyways unchanged for centuries. The city modernized without erasing itself.

The Old Quarter — known as the 36 Streets — dates back nearly a thousand years, and each street was historically named for the trade practiced there. Hang Gai (Silk Street) still sells silk. Hang Bac (Silver Street) still has jewelers. This living continuity is rare anywhere in the world, and in Hanoi it's not preserved behind glass or roped off with museum plaques. It's simply how people live.

There's also the food. Hanoi's culinary identity runs deeper than any other Vietnamese city. Pho was born here. Bun cha was born here. Egg coffee was invented here. The Hanoian approach to food is almost monk-like in its devotion: many restaurants serve a single dish, perfected over generations. A pho shop does not also sell banh mi. A bun cha vendor does not dabble in com tam. This singularity of purpose produces food of staggering quality at prices that feel almost criminal.

## What Are the Best Things to Do in Hanoi?

### Can I Explore the Old Quarter on Foot?

Absolutely — walking is the only proper way to experience Hanoi's Old Quarter. The 36 Streets form a dense grid of narrow lanes overflowing with life. Every corner reveals something: a tiny temple tucked between shopfronts, a woman grilling corn over charcoal, a barber giving haircuts on the sidewalk. No entrance fee — just comfortable shoes, patience with traffic, and a willingness to get lost.

I recommend starting at Dong Xuan Market, Hanoi's largest indoor market, and wandering south. The market itself is a sensory overload of dried goods, textiles, and kitchen supplies. From there, let the streets pull you. You'll pass through clusters of shops selling nothing but tin boxes, or nothing but Buddhist altars, or nothing but knockoff North Face jackets. The specialization is endlessly entertaining.

### Is the Temple of Literature Worth Visiting?

The Temple of Literature (Van Mieu) is Hanoi's most significant historical site and absolutely worth your time. Built in 1070, it served as Vietnam's first national university and is dedicated to Confucius. The complex spans five courtyards connected by gates and pathways, with the famous stone stelae — 82 carved tablets listing the names of doctoral graduates — standing as a UNESCO-recognized treasure.

**Entrance fee:** 30,000 VND ($1.20). Open daily 8:00–17:00. I visited at opening time and had the courtyards nearly to myself for the first thirty minutes. By 10:00 a.m., tour buses had arrived.

### What's the Story Behind Hoan Kiem Lake?

Hoan Kiem Lake sits at the heart of Hanoi both geographically and spiritually. The lake's name means "Lake of the Returned Sword," referencing the legend of Emperor Le Loi, who received a magical sword from a golden turtle to defeat Chinese invaders, then returned it to the turtle in this lake. Ngoc Son Temple occupies an island in the lake, connected by the iconic red Huc Bridge.

**Entrance fee to Ngoc Son Temple:** 30,000 VND ($1.20). The lake itself is free to walk around and is especially beautiful at dawn and dusk. On Friday, Saturday, and Sunday evenings, the surrounding streets close to traffic and become a massive pedestrian zone with live music, games, and street performers.

### Should I Visit Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum?

The Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum complex is a fascinating and sobering experience regardless of your political leanings. The embalmed body of Ho Chi Minh lies in a granite mausoleum modeled after Lenin's tomb in Moscow. The surrounding complex includes the Presidential Palace, Ho Chi Minh's surprisingly modest stilt house, and the One Pillar Pagoda.

**Entrance fee:** Free, but strict dress code (no shorts, tank tops, or hats inside). Open Tuesday–Thursday and Saturday–Sunday, 7:30–10:30 only. Closed October–November for annual maintenance. The line can be long, but it moves quickly. No cameras allowed inside the mausoleum itself.

### Are Water Puppet Shows Worth Seeing?

Thang Long Water Puppet Theatre offers one of Hanoi's most unique cultural experiences. Water puppetry originated in the rice paddies of the Red River Delta, and this art form exists nowhere else in the world. Puppeteers stand waist-deep in water behind a bamboo screen, manipulating wooden puppets that dance, fight dragons, and tell folk stories across the water's surface. Live traditional music accompanies every performance.

**Tickets:** 100,000–200,000 VND ($4–8) depending on seating. Shows run multiple times daily. I'd recommend [booking in advance through GetYourGuide](https://www.getyourguide.com/hanoi-l205/?partner_id=IVN6IQ3) during peak season (October–December) as shows sell out.

### Can I Take a Cooking Class in Hanoi?

A cooking class in Hanoi is one of the best investments you can make on this trip. Most classes begin with a guided tour of a local market where you'll learn to identify Vietnamese herbs and ingredients, then move to a kitchen to prepare three to four dishes. I took a class focused on pho, spring rolls, and bun cha, and I still use the pho recipe at home.

Expect to pay 700,000–1,200,000 VND ($28–48) per person for a half-day class. [Browse Hanoi cooking classes on GetYourGuide](https://www.getyourguide.com/hanoi-l205/cooking-classes-tc175/?partner_id=IVN6IQ3) to compare options and secure your spot.

## Where Should I Eat in Hanoi?

### Pho Thin — The Legendary Beef Pho

**Address:** 13 Lo Duc Street, Hai Ba Trung District

Pho Thin has been serving a single dish since 1979: pho bo (beef pho) with stir-fried beef. The owner, Mr. Thin, sears the beef in a screaming-hot wok before adding it to the broth, creating a caramelized, smoky depth that standard pho cannot match. A bowl costs 50,000 VND ($2). There is no menu. There are no options. Sit down and you receive pho. That's it.

### Bun Cha Huong Lien (Obama Bun Cha)

**Address:** 24 Le Van Huu Street, Hai Ba Trung District

This is the restaurant where Anthony Bourdain and Barack Obama shared bun cha and Hanoi beer in 2016. The table they sat at is now preserved behind glass. Hype aside, the bun cha here is genuinely excellent — charcoal-grilled pork patties swimming in a sweet-sour dipping broth with rice noodles and fresh herbs. A full set runs 50,000 VND ($2). Add a bia hoi (fresh draft beer) for 10,000 VND ($0.40).

### Cafe Giang — Birthplace of Egg Coffee

**Address:** 39 Nguyen Huu Huan Street, Old Quarter

Egg coffee (ca phe trung) was invented here in the 1940s when milk was scarce and Nguyen Van Giang whipped egg yolks with sugar and condensed milk as a substitute. The result is closer to a coffee-flavored tiramisu than a beverage. A cup costs 35,000 VND ($1.40). The upstairs seating overlooks the Old Quarter's rooftops and is worth the narrow staircase climb.

### Xoi Yen — Sticky Rice Perfection

**Address:** 35B Nguyen Huu Huan Street, Old Quarter

Xoi (sticky rice) is Hanoi's underrated breakfast champion. Xoi Yen serves it topped with everything from shredded chicken to mung bean paste to pork floss. A plate costs 20,000–40,000 VND ($0.80–1.60). The line at 7:00 a.m. tells you everything. I went with xoi xeo (turmeric sticky rice with mung bean and fried shallots) and it powered me through an entire morning of walking.

### Cha Ca Thang Long — Hanoi's Signature Fish Dish

**Address:** 19-21-31 Duong Thanh Street, Old Quarter

Cha ca (turmeric-marinated fish sizzled in a pan with dill and spring onions) is Hanoi's signature dish, and this restaurant does a superb version at a fraction of the price charged by the more famous Cha Ca La Vong. A serving with rice noodles, peanuts, and shrimp paste costs 120,000 VND ($4.80). The fish arrives still sizzling in the pan at your table.

## Where Should I Stay in Hanoi?

### Budget: Hanoi Old Quarter Hostel

A clean, well-located hostel right in the heart of the 36 Streets. Dorm beds start at 150,000 VND ($6) per night, and private rooms at 500,000 VND ($20). The rooftop terrace overlooks the Old Quarter chaos below. Staff are helpful with booking onward transport to Ha Long Bay and Sapa. [Check availability on Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/city/vn/hanoi.html?aid=2778866).

### Mid-Range: Hanoi La Siesta Hotel & Spa

Consistently rated among Hanoi's best mid-range hotels, La Siesta delivers boutique elegance in the Old Quarter at prices that feel like a steal. Rooms start around 1,500,000 VND ($60) per night and include breakfast buffet, a rooftop pool, and impeccable service. The staff here go above and beyond — they printed boarding passes for me without being asked. [Book on Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/hanoi-la-siesta.html?aid=2778866).

### Luxury: Sofitel Legend Metropole Hanoi

The Metropole is not just a hotel; it's a piece of Hanoi's history. Built in 1901, this French colonial landmark has hosted Graham Greene, Charlie Chaplin, and Jane Fonda. The heritage wing retains its original character, while the opera wing offers modern luxury. Rooms start around 5,000,000 VND ($200) per night. Even if you don't stay here, the hotel's Angelina restaurant serves outstanding afternoon tea, and the wartime bunker tour beneath the hotel is fascinating. [Book on Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/sofitel-legend-metropole-hanoi.html?aid=2778866).

### Mid-Range Alternative: Essence Hanoi Hotel & Spa

Another excellent Old Quarter option with rooms from 1,200,000 VND ($48) per night. The breakfast spread is exceptional for the price, and the location on Ta Hien Street puts you steps from Hanoi's famous "Beer Corner." [Book on Booking.com](https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/essence-hanoi.html?aid=2778866).

## Scott's Pro Tips for Visiting Hanoi

### When Is the Best Time to Visit?

October through December is the sweet spot — warm days, cool evenings, and minimal rain. March and April also work well, with spring flowers blooming around Hoan Kiem Lake. Avoid June through August unless you enjoy sweating through your shirt by 8:00 a.m. January and February can be surprisingly chilly (10–15°C) with persistent drizzle; pack a light jacket.

### How Do I Get Around the City?

**Grab (Southeast Asia's Uber)** is your best friend. Download the app before you arrive. A Grab motorbike across the city costs 20,000–40,000 VND ($0.80–1.60), and a Grab car runs 50,000–100,000 VND ($2–4). Traditional taxis work too — use Mai Linh or Vinasun to avoid scams. For the Old Quarter, walking is best. Hanoi's public bus system is cheap (7,000 VND / $0.28 per ride) and surprisingly functional once you figure out the routes.

### What About Money and Payments?

Vietnam runs on cash. ATMs are everywhere and dispense up to 3,000,000–5,000,000 VND per withdrawal. Many charge 22,000–55,000 VND in fees, but Techcombank and VP Bank ATMs are often fee-free for international cards. Carry small bills — breaking 500,000 VND notes at small vendors can be difficult. Credit cards are accepted at hotels and upscale restaurants but not at street food stalls or small shops.

### Is Hanoi Safe?

Hanoi is remarkably safe. Violent crime against tourists is extremely rare. The main risks are petty theft (bag-snatching from motorbikes) and traffic accidents. Keep your phone in a front pocket or crossbody bag, and never walk while looking at your phone near the road. Crossing the street is an art form: walk slowly, steadily, and predictably. Do not stop, do not run, do not make sudden movements. The traffic will flow around you like water around a stone.

I always travel with insurance — [SafetyWing's Nomad Insurance](https://safetywing.com/?referenceID=24858745) starts at around $42/month and covers medical emergencies, which gives genuine peace of mind for motorbike-heavy cities like Hanoi.

### What Should I Pack for Hanoi?

Pack layers. Even in warm months, air-conditioned restaurants and buses can be cold. A packable rain jacket is essential year-round. Comfortable walking shoes matter more here than almost anywhere — the Old Quarter sidewalks are uneven, often occupied by parked motorbikes, and you'll do 15,000+ steps daily without trying. A small crossbody bag keeps valuables secure. Bring a reusable water bottle — many cafes and hostels offer free refills.

### Cultural Tips

Remove shoes before entering temples and homes. Dress modestly at religious sites — cover shoulders and knees. When receiving or giving anything, use both hands or your right hand. Learn "xin chao" (hello) and "cam on" (thank you) — even basic Vietnamese goes a long way. Don't blow your nose at the table. When drinking with locals, say "mot, hai, ba, yo!" (one, two, three, cheers!) before clinking glasses.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Hanoi

### Is Hanoi safe for solo travelers?

Hanoi is very safe for solo travelers. Petty theft like bag-snatching can occur on busy streets, so keep valuables close. The biggest actual danger is crossing the road — walk steadily and predictably, and traffic will flow around you. I traveled solo here for over a week and never felt unsafe, even walking the Old Quarter late at night.

### How many days do I need in Hanoi?

Three to four full days lets you cover the Old Quarter, major sights, a cooking class, and still have time for aimless wandering. Add a day if you want a day trip to Bat Trang ceramics village or Perfume Pagoda. I'd also recommend building in at least one "no plans" day — some of my best Hanoi memories came from simply following interesting alleys without a destination.

### What is the best time of year to visit Hanoi?

October through December offers cool, dry weather ideal for walking. March and April bring pleasant spring temperatures. Avoid June through August when heat and humidity are intense, and January can be surprisingly cold and drizzly. I visited in November and the weather was near-perfect — warm enough for a t-shirt during the day, cool enough for a light jacket in the evening.

### Can I drink the tap water in Hanoi?

No. Always drink bottled or filtered water. Most hotels provide complimentary bottles, and refill stations are increasingly common at hostels and cafes. Ice in restaurants and cafes is generally safe — it's commercially produced from purified water. Street-side ice from unknown sources is a gamble I'd skip.

### How do I get from Hanoi to Ha Long Bay?

Most visitors book a shuttle through their cruise operator (4 hours each way). Public buses from My Dinh station cost around 120,000 VND ($5). Private car transfers run about 1,500,000 VND ($60) one way. I recommend [booking a Ha Long Bay cruise package through GetYourGuide](https://www.getyourguide.com/ha-long-bay-l554/?partner_id=IVN6IQ3) — most include round-trip transport from Hanoi, which eliminates the logistics headache entirely.
