faqItems:
  - question: "Is Nha Trang too touristy?"
    answer: "Parts of the beachfront are heavily touristed, yes. But walking a few blocks inland reveals a thoroughly Vietnamese city with excellent local food. The islands offshore provide escape from the crowds, and the northern beaches are quieter."
  - question: "Is the diving good in Nha Trang?"
    answer: "For Vietnam, yes - Nha Trang has the best-developed diving scene in the country. The visibility is good (10-30m depending on season). It is not the Maldives, but for a PADI Open Water course at a fraction of Western prices, it is excellent."
  - question: "What is the mud bath experience like?"
    answer: "More fun than I expected. The Thap Ba Hot Springs offers mineral mud baths where you soak in warm, thick mud. A basic mud bath costs 250,000-400,000 VND ($10-$16). I felt ridiculous and relaxed in equal measure."
  - question: "Is Nha Trang safe for swimming?"
    answer: "The main beach is generally safe with lifeguards on duty during the day. Riptides can occur during the rainy season (October-December). Follow flag warnings and stay within designated swimming areas."
  - question: "How is the nightlife?"
    answer: "Nha Trang has the most active nightlife scene outside of Ho Chi Minh City. The Sailing Club on the beach is the iconic spot. Drinks are cheap: beer from 15,000 VND ($0.60), cocktails from 80,000 VND ($3.20)."

# Nha Trang: Vietnam's Riviera

I arrived in Nha Trang from Da Lat—dropping from cool mountain air to coastal heat in a three-hour bus ride—and the first thing I did was walk straight to the beach. The sand stretched for what looked like forever, curving along a bay fringed with islands, and the water was the kind of turquoise you assume is Photoshopped until you see it in person. I swam for thirty minutes, dried off in the sun, and ordered a plate of grilled shrimp and a beer from a beachfront vendor. The shrimp cost 60,000 VND ($2.40), the beer cost 15,000 VND ($0.60), and the combination of salt water, sunshine, and fresh seafood produced a feeling of contentment so deep it bordered on philosophical. Nha Trang is not a complicated city. It delivers exactly what it promises: beach, sun, sea, and pleasure.

Nha Trang has been Vietnam's beach capital for decades, and the infrastructure shows it. The waterfront promenade buzzes with activity from dawn joggers to midnight strollers. Hotels line the beachfront in every price bracket. The diving scene is the most developed in Vietnam, and island-hopping tours depart every morning. It is, unapologetically, a resort city—and if that is what you want after weeks of temple-hopping and trekking, it delivers without apology.

But Nha Trang is not just a beach. The Po Nagar Cham Towers, standing on a hill overlooking the Cai River, date back to the 7th century and are among the best-preserved Cham religious sites in Vietnam. I climbed the hill on my second morning and found myself alone among the brick towers, looking out over the river and the city, thinking about the Cham civilization that once controlled this coast.

I also discovered that the local food scene goes far beyond the tourist restaurants lining the beach. A ten-minute walk inland took me to neighborhoods where locals gather for bun ca (fish noodle soup), banh can (miniature savory pancakes cooked in clay molds), and nem nuong (grilled pork sausage wrapped in rice paper with herbs). These dishes are specific to Nha Trang and Khanh Hoa province, and they were some of the most interesting things I ate in Vietnam.

The islands offshore are the other major draw. I joined a day trip that visited three islands, with snorkeling at Mun Island Marine Protected Area, lunch on a boat, and a final stop at an island beach for swimming. The coral was healthy and colorful, the fish were abundant, and the boat ride between islands showed the bay from angles that made me understand why the French colonists chose this spot for their Riviera.

## What Makes Nha Trang Different

Nha Trang is the most straightforwardly fun destination on this list. While other Vietnamese cities demand cultural engagement and emotional energy, Nha Trang asks only that you show up, swim, eat, and enjoy yourself. After the intensity of Hue's imperial history or the physical demands of Sapa's treks, Nha Trang's uncomplicated pleasures feel earned and necessary.

The city also offers the most accessible marine experiences in Vietnam. The diving, snorkeling, and island-hopping here are well-organized and affordable. I met backpackers who got their diving certification for $300 and luxury travelers who chartered private boats to remote islands. Nha Trang accommodates both with equal ease.

## Things to Do in Nha Trang

### Hit the Beach
Nha Trang's 6km main beach is the centerpiece. The sand is clean, the water is warm, and sunbed rentals cost about 50,000 VND ($2). For a quieter experience, head to Bai Dai beach north of the city.

### Go Island Hopping
Full-day tours typically visit 3-4 islands with snorkeling, swimming, and lunch. Tours cost 250,000-500,000 VND ($10-$20). I recommend tours that include Mun Island for the best snorkeling.

### Visit Po Nagar Cham Towers
These Hindu-Buddhist towers were built between the 7th and 12th centuries and remain an active place of worship. Entry is 22,000 VND ($0.90). The hilltop location provides panoramic views.

### Take a Mud Bath at Thap Ba Hot Springs
Individual mud baths cost 250,000 VND ($10), or splash out on VIP pools for 400,000 VND ($16). I went with low expectations and left with impossibly soft skin and a wide smile.

### Get Certified to Dive
A PADI Open Water course costs 5,000,000-8,000,000 VND ($200-$320). For certified divers, fun dives cost 600,000-1,000,000 VND ($24-$40) for two dives.

### Walk the Waterfront at Night
The promenade comes alive after dark with families, street performers, and food vendors. Fresh fruit smoothies cost 25,000 VND ($1) and grilled corn costs 15,000 VND ($0.60).

## Where to Eat in Nha Trang

### Nem Nuong Dang Van Quyen (16A Lan Ong)
Nem nuong (grilled pork sausage) is Nha Trang's most famous dish. You get sausages, rice paper, herbs, and dipping sauces, and wrap your own rolls. A full set costs 80,000 VND ($3.20).

### Lac Canh (44 Nguyen Binh Khiem)
A legendary grill-your-own restaurant operating since 1975. The beef is marinated in a sweet, garlicky sauce. A meal for one costs 100,000-150,000 VND ($4-$6).

### Bun Ca Su (Various Locations)
Bun ca (fish noodle soup) is a Nha Trang specialty—rice vermicelli in a light, tangy broth with fresh fish. Street stalls serve it for 30,000-40,000 VND ($1.20-$1.60).

### Banh Can Nha Trang (Near Dam Market)
Tiny savory pancakes cooked in clay molds, filled with egg, shrimp, or squid. A serving of 6-8 costs 30,000 VND ($1.20).

### Louisiane Brewhouse (Tran Phu Beach Road)
House-brewed craft beer, international food, a swimming pool, and live music. A burger and a pint costs about 250,000 VND ($10).

## Where to Stay in Nha Trang

### Budget: Mojzo Dorm ($6-$12/night)
Capsule-style pods near the beach from 150,000 VND ($6). Rooftop bar with ocean views.

### Mid-Range: Novotel Nha Trang ($60-$110/night)
Beachfront location, rooftop pool, modern rooms. The beach is across the road. Breakfast included.

### Luxury: Six Senses Ninh Van Bay ($250-$600/night)
Reachable only by speedboat, this resort occupies its own dramatic bay backed by boulders and jungle. The villas are extraordinary and the isolation is total.

## Scott's Pro Tips for Nha Trang

**Getting There:** Fly into Cam Ranh Airport (CXR), 35km south. The airport shuttle bus costs 65,000 VND ($2.60). If coming from Da Lat, the 3-hour bus ride drops dramatically from mountain to coast—sit on the left for the best views.

**Best Time to Visit:** January through August is dry and warm. The wettest months are October through December, with occasional typhoons. I visited in March and had unbroken sunshine.

**Getting Around:** The tourist area is walkable. Grab is cheap for longer distances. Bicycle rental (30,000 VND / $1.20 per day) is pleasant along the beachfront. Motorbike rental (100,000 VND / $4 per day) opens up the northern beaches.

**Money:** ATMs are everywhere along the beachfront. Tourist prices are common on the main strip—walk a block inland for local prices.

**Safety:** Main concerns are petty theft on the beach and sunburn. Swim within flagged areas and follow lifeguard guidance.

**Packing:** Swimwear, sunscreen (SPF 50+), and reef-safe sunscreen for snorkeling. A light cover-up for temples.

**Culture:** Cover up when leaving the beach. The Cham Towers are an active religious site—remove shoes and dress modestly.
