faqItems:
  - question: "How many days should I spend in Hoi An?"
    answer: "I spent five days and could have stayed longer. At minimum, give yourself three full days: one for the Ancient Town, one for a cooking class and beach, and one for cycling the countryside. If you want tailored clothing, add another day to allow for fittings."
  - question: "Is Hoi An too touristy?"
    answer: "The Ancient Town gets crowded, especially around the Japanese Bridge. But step two blocks in any direction and you find quiet neighborhoods, local cafes, and empty rice paddies. The tourism is well-managed and the town's beauty is genuine. I visited in shoulder season (March) and found a perfect balance."
  - question: "Do I need to buy a ticket for the Ancient Town?"
    answer: "Yes. An Old Town ticket costs 120,000 VND ($5) and grants entry to five of the town's heritage sites (museums, assembly halls, old houses). The ticket is not required just to walk the streets—only for specific attractions. It is valid for 24 hours. I used all five entries easily in one afternoon."
  - question: "Should I get clothes tailored in Hoi An?"
    answer: "If you have time, absolutely. Hoi An is world-famous for its tailors, who can produce custom suits, dresses, shoes, and leather goods in 24-48 hours. Quality varies enormously—research shops beforehand and look for recent reviews. I had a linen suit made and it remains one of my favorite pieces of clothing."
  - question: "How is the flooding in Hoi An?"
    answer: "October through December is the rainy season, and the Ancient Town floods regularly—sometimes waist-deep. Some travelers enjoy the surreal experience of canoeing down streets that are normally pedestrian. I preferred to visit in dry season and see the town as it was meant to be experienced."
  - question: "Is Hoi An good for vegetarians?"
    answer: "Excellent. The town has a strong vegetarian food scene, partly due to the Buddhist tradition of eating vegetarian on the 1st and 15th of each lunar month. Many restaurants offer dedicated vegetarian menus, and the cooking classes all accommodate vegetarian diets."

# Hoi An: The Town That Time Preserved

I arrived in Hoi An on a bicycle, pedaling the flat coastal road from Da Nang past rice paddies and fishing villages, and as I crossed the bridge into the Ancient Town I felt something I had not experienced anywhere else in Vietnam: stillness. The motorbikes that define every other Vietnamese city are banned from the old streets here. Instead, there were bicycles, cyclos, and pedestrians walking beneath silk lanterns that hung across narrow lanes like strings of jewels. The yellow-walled buildings, their paint faded to a dozen shades of ochre and gold, leaned toward each other across the street as if sharing secrets. I locked my bike, walked into the first alley I found, and spent the next five days utterly enchanted.

Hoi An was once one of the most important trading ports in Southeast Asia. Between the 15th and 19th centuries, Japanese, Chinese, and European merchants sailed up the Thu Bon River to trade silk, porcelain, and spices. They left behind a town that blends architectural styles from across the world—Japanese merchants built the iconic covered bridge, Chinese traders constructed elaborate assembly halls, French colonists added their signature shuttered windows, and Vietnamese families layered everything with their own aesthetic. The result is a place that looks like nowhere else on earth, and when I walked its streets at dusk with the lanterns glowing, I understood why over three million people visit each year.

But Hoi An's magic is not just visual. This tiny town punches absurdly above its weight in food. Cao lau—thick noodles in a small amount of rich broth, topped with pork, greens, and croutons, made with water from a specific local well—exists only here. White rose dumplings (banh bao banh vac), translucent parcels of shrimp, are a Hoi An original. The banh mi here are often cited as the best in Vietnam, and after eating my way through the country, I am inclined to agree. I took a cooking class on my second day and it became one of the highlights of my entire trip—walking through the morning market with a chef, selecting ingredients, and learning to prepare dishes whose recipes have been guarded for generations.

I also discovered that Hoi An has a quieter side that most visitors miss. Cycling just ten minutes from the Ancient Town, I found myself surrounded by rice paddies, water buffalo, and farming villages where life moves at an entirely different pace. An Bang Beach, a short ride further, offers excellent swimming and beachfront restaurants without the development of Da Nang. And the coconut-palm waterways of Cam Thanh, where local fishermen navigate circular basket boats, felt like a different world entirely.

The tailoring deserves its own mention. Hoi An has hundreds of tailors who can produce custom suits, dresses, coats, shoes, and bags in as little as 24 hours. I walked into a shop on a Tuesday afternoon, chose fabric for a linen suit, was measured in ten minutes, and picked up the finished product on Wednesday evening. The fit was perfect, the price was a fraction of what I would pay at home, and I still wear that suit regularly. If you have any interest in custom clothing, Hoi An is the place.

## What Makes Hoi An Different

Hoi An is the only place in Vietnam where I could walk for hours without hearing a motorbike engine. The Ancient Town's pedestrian-friendly streets create an atmosphere that is completely unique in this country—peaceful, intimate, and human-scaled. The UNESCO World Heritage designation has protected the architecture from the modernization that has transformed other Vietnamese cities, and the result is a living museum that does not feel like a museum at all. People still live and work in these buildings. Families still hang laundry across balconies that overlook 400-year-old streets. The preservation is not sterile—it is vibrant and ongoing.

The town also has a creative energy that sets it apart. The tailoring tradition has spawned a broader artisan culture—leather workers, silk weavers, ceramic artists, and lantern makers all operate workshops in and around the Ancient Town. The food scene is innovative, with young Vietnamese chefs opening restaurants that reinterpret traditional recipes with modern techniques. And the nightly lantern market, where hundreds of silk lanterns glow along the riverbank, transforms the town into something that feels genuinely otherworldly.

## Things to Do in Hoi An

### Walk the Ancient Town at Night
This is the single most atmospheric experience I had in Vietnam. After dark, the electric lights are dimmed, silk lanterns glow in every color, and the Thu Bon River reflects it all. The night market along Nguyen Hoang sets up with food stalls, lantern vendors, and floating candle sellers. I walked these streets every evening and they never lost their magic. The Old Town ticket (120,000 VND / $5) covers five heritage site entries.

### Take a Cooking Class
Hoi An's cooking classes are legendary, and for good reason. Most start with a guided tour of the central market where you learn to identify ingredients and navigate the stalls. Then you cook four or five dishes—typically cao lau, white rose dumplings, banh xeo, and a curry—and eat everything afterward. Prices range from 500,000–900,000 VND ($20–$37). I booked at Red Bridge Cooking School and it was outstanding.

### Get Clothes Tailored
Research is key—quality varies dramatically between shops. I recommend Yaly Couture, BeBe, and A Dong Silk based on personal experience and extensive reviews. A custom suit runs 3,000,000–7,000,000 VND ($120–$280), a dress 500,000–2,000,000 VND ($20–$80), and leather shoes 800,000–2,000,000 VND ($32–$80). Allow at least two days for fittings and adjustments.

### Cycle to An Bang Beach
Rent a bicycle from your hotel (usually free or 30,000 VND / $1.20 per day) and ride 4km to An Bang Beach. The ride through rice paddies is beautiful, and the beach has a laid-back atmosphere with beachfront restaurants serving fresh seafood and cold beer. I spent several afternoons here, alternating between swimming and reading under a palm umbrella.

### Visit My Son Sanctuary
These Cham temple ruins, a UNESCO World Heritage Site about 40km from Hoi An, date from the 4th to 14th centuries. The sunrise tour (departure around 5:00 AM) is worth the early alarm—you get soft light, cool temperatures, and minimal crowds. Entry is 150,000 VND ($6). A guided tour from Hoi An costs 300,000–600,000 VND ($12–$24) including transport.

### Ride a Basket Boat in Cam Thanh
The coconut-palm waterways just outside Hoi An are navigated by traditional basket boats (thung chai). Local guides paddle you through the palms, demonstrate fishing techniques, and often break into song. Tours cost 150,000–300,000 VND ($6–$12). I found it genuinely delightful—the guides have incredible boat-handling skills and a great sense of humor.

### Release Lanterns on the Thu Bon River
On the 14th day of each lunar month, the Ancient Town holds a full-moon lantern festival where electric lights are turned off and candle-lit lanterns float on the river. Even on regular evenings, you can buy paper lanterns for 10,000–20,000 VND ($0.40–$0.80) and set them adrift. It is touristy but genuinely beautiful.

## Where to Eat in Hoi An

### Banh Mi Phuong (2B Phan Chau Trinh)
Anthony Bourdain called this "the best banh mi in the world," and while I do not hand out superlatives lightly, I understand why he said it. The bread is impossibly crispy, the filling combinations are creative, and the whole package costs 30,000 VND ($1.20). I ate here my first morning and returned every morning after. The line moves fast.

### Morning Glory (106 Nguyen Thai Hoc)
Chef Trinh Diem Vy's restaurant is the best place to try the full range of Hoi An specialties in one sitting. Cao lau, white rose, fried wontons, and banh xeo are all excellent. Dishes cost 60,000–120,000 VND ($2.40–$5). The atmosphere is charming, with tables overlooking the Ancient Town streets. Book ahead for dinner.

### Cao Lau Thanh (26 Thai Phien)
A tiny local spot that serves what I believe is the best cao lau in town. The noodles are thick and chewy, the pork is tender, and the broth is deeply flavored. A bowl costs 30,000 VND ($1.20). There are maybe six tables and no English menu, but point at what others are eating and you will be fine.

### Madam Khanh - The Banh Mi Queen (115 Tran Cao Van)
The eternal rival to Banh Mi Phuong, and some locals argue she is the true queen of Hoi An banh mi. Her version is slightly different—heavier on the pate and chili—and costs 25,000 VND ($1). I ate at both repeatedly and honestly could not pick a winner. Try both and form your own opinion.

### Ong Hai (Cam Nam Island)
Cross the bridge to Cam Nam Island for this riverside restaurant specializing in banh dap (crispy rice crackers with soft rice paper) and grilled meats. A full meal costs about 100,000 VND ($4). The setting—overlooking the river with the Ancient Town in the background—is wonderful, and the food is authentic home-style cooking.

### Secret Garden (132/2 Tran Phu)
Hidden down an alley and up a staircase (the hunt is part of the fun), this rooftop restaurant serves excellent Vietnamese home cooking in a garden setting. Dishes cost 50,000–100,000 VND ($2–$4). I had the best ca kho to (caramelized fish in clay pot) of my trip here. The view over the Ancient Town rooftops at sunset is special.

## Where to Stay in Hoi An

### Budget: Tribee Bana Hostel ($6–$12/night)
A stylish hostel with dorm beds from 150,000 VND ($6) and a social atmosphere. The pool is a huge bonus in Hoi An's heat. Located a 10-minute walk from the Ancient Town, which keeps the price down while keeping you close to the action.

### Mid-Range: Allegro Hoi An ($70–$120/night)
My pick for the best value in Hoi An. Beautiful rooms, an inviting pool, excellent breakfast, and a five-minute walk to the Ancient Town. The staff were exceptional—they arranged cooking classes, restaurant bookings, and bicycle rentals without my having to research anything.

### Luxury: Anantara Hoi An Resort ($150–$350/night)
Right on the Thu Bon riverfront in the Ancient Town, this resort blends colonial architecture with modern luxury. The riverside pool is beautiful, the spa uses local ingredients, and the location means you step out the door into the heart of the old streets. The on-site restaurant serves refined Vietnamese cuisine with views of the river.

## Scott's Pro Tips for Hoi An

**Getting There:** Fly into Da Nang (DAD) and take a Grab (200,000–300,000 VND / $8–$12) or the public bus (30,000 VND / $1.20). Many hotels offer free or cheap shuttle services from Da Nang airport—ask when booking. The drive takes about 40 minutes and passes through pleasant coastal scenery.

**Best Time to Visit:** February through June offers dry weather and comfortable temperatures. July and August are hot but still dry. September through January is the rainy season, with October and November bringing the highest risk of flooding in the Ancient Town. I visited in March and the weather was ideal.

**Getting Around:** Bicycle is the way to move in Hoi An. The town is flat, compact, and most hotels provide free bikes. The Ancient Town core is pedestrian-only after certain hours. For trips to An Bang Beach or Cam Thanh, a bicycle is perfect. For Da Nang day trips, use Grab.

**Money:** Cash is king in Hoi An's markets, food stalls, and smaller shops. ATMs are available on the main streets. Most hotels and upscale restaurants accept cards. Tailoring shops generally accept both cash and card. Keep 500,000 VND ($20) in small bills for daily exploring.

**Safety:** Hoi An is extremely safe—one of the safest places I visited in all of Vietnam. The pedestrian streets eliminate traffic risks. The main concerns are sunburn (carry sunscreen) and overcharging at markets (bargain firmly but politely). I walked everywhere at all hours without a second thought.

**Packing:** Bring comfortable walking shoes—the Ancient Town streets are uneven stone and can be slippery when wet. Light, breathable clothing is essential. If you plan to get tailoring done, bring photos of styles you like and any existing garments that fit you well for the tailor to reference.

**Culture:** Hoi An's residents have been welcoming traders from around the world for centuries, and that hospitality is genuine. Remove shoes when entering homes and assembly halls. Many heritage sites require modest dress. The full-moon lantern festival (14th of each lunar month) is worth timing your visit around.
